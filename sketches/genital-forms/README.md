# Genital Forms

Procedural 3D generative art exploring the full spectrum of human genital anatomy through abstract sculptural forms.

## Concept

This piece treats human anatomy as a subject of artistic exploration, similar to classical sculpture traditions. Forms range from anatomically-referenced to highly abstract, rendered in materials from clay to chrome to cosmic textures.

## Features

- **6 Form Types:** Phallic, vulvic, intersex, ambiguous, abstract, morphic
- **20 Materials:** Natural (clay, marble, bronze), synthetic (chrome, neon), surreal (galaxy, liquid)
- **5 Render Styles:** Smooth, low-poly, wireframe, faceted, organic
- **Soft-Body Physics:** Jiggle and gravity simulation
- **Rare Compositions:** Occasionally generates paired forms

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Drag | Rotate view |
| Scroll | Zoom |
| R | Regenerate |
| S | Save PNG |
| P | Toggle physics |
| A | Toggle auto-rotate |

## Rarity System

| Tier | Form Types | Materials |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Common | Phallic, Vulvic | Clay, Ceramic, Plastic, Rubber |
| Uncommon | - | Marble, Bronze, Jade, Silicone, Flesh |
| Rare | Intersex, Ambiguous | Chrome, Neon, Glass |
| Legendary | Abstract, Morphic | Liquid, Galaxy, Iridescent |

Paired compositions are legendary-tier regardless of other features.

## Technical

Built with Three.js. All geometry is procedurally generated using parametric equations and noise displacement. Physics simulation uses a simple spring-mass system.
