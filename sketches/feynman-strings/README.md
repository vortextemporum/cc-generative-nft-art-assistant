# Feynman Strings

Generative art inspired by the visual language of particle physics and string theory.

## Concept

The piece explores the aesthetic beauty of theoretical physics diagrams:

- **Feynman diagrams** - The iconic notation for particle interactions
- **String theory** - Worldsheets, vibrating strings, and extra dimensions
- **Quantum vacuum** - Virtual particles bubbling in empty space

Each generation creates a unique composition ranging from clean technical diagrams to chaotic quantum abstractions.

## Modes

### QED (Quantum Electrodynamics)
The simplest quantum field theory. Features photon propagators (wavy golden lines), electron lines (straight with arrows), and clean interaction vertices.

### QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics)
The theory of quarks and gluons. Features color-charged quark lines (red, green, blue), curly gluon propagators, and color confinement tubes.

### String Theory
The framework unifying all forces. Features worldsheet surfaces traced by strings, vibration mode harmonics, and rare Calabi-Yau manifold projections.

### Quantum Vacuum
The seething emptiness of space. Features virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, quantum foam textures, uncertainty clouds, and Casimir effect plates.

## Features

- **Mode Blending**: Single mode to chaotic four-mode combinations
- **Variable Density**: From minimal textbook diagrams to dense quantum chaos
- **Multiple Styles**: Technical, artistic, abstract, chaotic
- **Rare Special Features**: Higgs vertex (5%), Calabi-Yau (3%), Graviton (2%), Supersymmetry (4%)
