# Rayincarnations Fork

A generative artwork exploring form as the result of interaction between visible processes and underlying, unseen structures.

Inspired by [Volatile Moods](https://www.volatilemoods.art/)' "Rayincarnations" (2026).

## Concept

Every piece consists of two layers:
- **Hidden structures** - Mathematical patterns (flow fields, radial emanations, grids, spirals) that exist beneath the surface
- **Visible processes** - Artistic forms (organic shapes, tendrils, dots, waves) that respond to and reveal these structures

The interplay creates emergent complexity where the invisible becomes partially visible through its effects on form.

## Features

| Feature | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Structure | radial, flow, grid, spiral, voronoi |
| Process | organic, linear, dots, waves, tendrils |
| Interaction | reveal, distort, attract, repel, layer |
| Color | monochrome, sepia, tinted |
| Density | sparse, balanced, dense |
| Complexity | minimal, moderate, complex |

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| T | Toggle paper texture |
| W | Toggle black/white vs sepia |
| S | Save PNG |
| R | Regenerate with new hash |
| 0-8 | Hi-res export (4k-20k) |

## Technical

- Built with p5.js
- fxhash compatible (uses fxrand PRNG)
- Responsive canvas sizing
- HSB color mode
- Paper texture grain effect

## Version

1.0.0 - Initial release
