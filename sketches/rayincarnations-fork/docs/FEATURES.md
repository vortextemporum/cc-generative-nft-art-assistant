# Rayincarnations Fork - Features

## Feature Taxonomy

### Hidden Structure Types

| Type | Description | Visual Effect |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| radial | Concentric rings from 2-16 points | Circular distortions, ripple effects |
| flow | Perlin noise flow field | Organic curves, directional flow |
| grid | Hidden rectangular grid | Angular alignments, structured chaos |
| spiral | 1-5 spiral attractors | Swirling forms, rotational energy |
| voronoi | Cell boundaries from seed points | Cellular organization, territory |

### Visible Process Types

| Type | Description | Elements |
|------|-------------|----------|
| organic | Blob-like closed forms | Curves, fills, interior dots |
| linear | Stroke lines | Bent paths, varying weight |
| dots | Point clusters | Size/brightness variation |
| waves | Horizontal wave lines | Vertical displacement |
| tendrils | Growing paths | Following structure forces |

### Interaction Modes

| Mode | How Structure Affects Process |
|------|------------------------------|
| reveal | Density increases where structure is strong |
| distort | Forms bend along structure vectors |
| attract | Elements pulled toward structure centers |
| repel | Elements pushed away, creating voids |
| layer | Both layers visible, blended |

### Color Modes

| Mode | Palette | Probability |
|------|---------|-------------|
| monochrome | Black/white/gray | ~50% |
| sepia | Warm browns/creams | ~33% |
| tinted | Subtle hue shift | ~17% |

### Density Levels

| Level | Element Count | Probability |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| sparse | 0.5× base | ~20% |
| balanced | 1× base | ~40% |
| dense | 2× base | ~40% |

### Complexity Levels

| Level | Structure Elements | Probability |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| minimal | 2-4 | ~25% |
| moderate | 4-8 | ~35% |
| complex | 8-16 | ~40% |

## Rarity Combinations

### Common (~60%)
- monochrome + balanced density
- flow/radial structure + organic/dots process
- distort interaction

### Uncommon (~30%)
- sepia coloring
- complex density
- spiral/voronoi structure
- tendril/wave process

### Rare (~10%)
- tinted color mode
- minimal complexity with dense output
- repel interaction (creates dramatic negative space)
- square orientation

## Feature Interactions

Some combinations create distinctive visual effects:

| Structure | Process | Interaction | Result |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| spiral | tendrils | attract | Spiraling organic growth |
| radial | dots | reveal | Ripple patterns in dot density |
| flow | organic | distort | Flowing blob deformations |
| grid | linear | distort | Angular geometric patterns |
| voronoi | dots | attract | Cellular dot clustering |
